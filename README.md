# delayed-streams-modeling
Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM) is a flexible formulation for streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning.

## Speech To Text

DSM can be used to build streaming speech to text models. These models can be
batched for efficiency, return word level timestamps,  and are great for
interactive applications. We provide two such models, these models are
characterized by their size as well as the delay it takes for audio to be
transcribed into text. We provide two such models:
- An English only model with ~2.6b parameters using a 2.5 second delay,
  `kyutai/stt-2.6b-en`.
- An English and French model with ~1b parameters using a 0.5 second delay,
  `kyutai/stt-1b-en_fr`.

This requires the [moshi package](https://pypi.org/project/moshi/)
with version 0.2.5 or later, which can be installed via pip.

```bash
# wget https://github.com/metavoiceio/metavoice-src/raw/main/assets/bria.mp3
python -m moshi.run_inference --hf-repo kyutai/stt-2.6b-en bria.mp3
```

### MLX implementation
[[Hugging Face]](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/stt-2.6b-en-mlx)

This requires the [moshi-mlx package](https://pypi.org/project/moshi-mlx/)
with version 0.2.5 or later, which can be installed via pip.

```bash
# wget https://github.com/metavoiceio/metavoice-src/raw/main/assets/bria.mp3
python -m moshi_mlx.run_inference --hf-repo kyutai/stt-2.6b-en-mlx bria.mp3 --temp 0
```

### Rust implementation
[[Hugging Face]](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/stt-2.6b-en-candle)

A standalone Rust example is provided in the `stt-rs` directory in this repo.
This can be used as follows:
```bash
cd stt-rs
cargo run --features cuda -r -- bria.mp3
```

### Rust server
[[Hugging Face]](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/stt-2.6b-en-candle)

The Rust implementation provides a server that can process multiple streaming
queries in parallel. Dependening on the amount of memory on your GPU, you may
have to adjust the batch size from the config file. For a L40S GPU, a batch size
of 64 works well.

In order to run the server, install the `moshi-server` crate via the following
command. The server code can be found in the
[kyutai-labs/moshi](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi/tree/main/rust/moshi-server)
repository.
```bash
cargo install --features cuda moshi-server
```

Then the server can be started via the following command using the config file
from this repository.
```bash
moshi-server worker --config configs/config-stt-hf.toml
```

Once the server has started you can run a streaming inference with the following
script.
```bash
# wget https://github.com/metavoiceio/metavoice-src/raw/main/assets/bria.mp3
uv run scripts/asr-streaming-query.py bria.mp3
```

The script simulates some real-time processing of the audio. Faster processing
can be triggered by setting the real-time factor, e.g. `--rtf 500` will process
the data as fast as possible.
